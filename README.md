# The Dim Sum Game

## Overview

In the game, users choose ingredient cards from a deck and tap them on the RFID reader. The display screen instantly updates with information about the selected ingredient. By tapping multiple ingredients, users can potentially create a dim sum dish, and the screen then presents the dish's history and cultural significance. This mechanism allows users to explore Chinese cuisine, learn about ingredients, and experience the storytelling aspect of creating traditional dishes.
