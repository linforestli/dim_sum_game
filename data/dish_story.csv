Siumai1,"At the end of the Ming Dynasty and the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, near the Dazhao Temple, there were two brothers who made their living by selling buns. Later, the elder brother got married, and his wife wanted to split the household. The bun shop was given to the brother and his wife, while the younger brother worked in the shop making and selling buns. Despite his kindness, the younger brother had no income other than his food. To increase his earnings for future marriage, he started making some buns with thin skins and open tops while steaming them, selling them separately.
