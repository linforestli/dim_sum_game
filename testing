Once upon a time, in a bustling city filled with the aroma of delicious food, there was a quaint little dim sum restaurant called "Dim Sum Delights." The restaurant was known far and wide for its exquisite dim sum dishes, each bursting with flavor and creativity. 

One day, you decided to visit Dim Sum Delights for a fun lunch outing. As you sat down at their table, they noticed a unique set of cards placed in front of them. The cards were adorned with colorful illustrations of various dim sum ingredients like shrimp, pork, and mushrooms. 

Now, tap your cards to explore the world of dim sum...
